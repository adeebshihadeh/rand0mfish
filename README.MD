# rand0mfish

a bot for lichess.org that only plays <=1 minute games (bullet and ultrabullet) with no increment

each turn it randomly chooses either a stockfish move or a random move

challenge [@rand0mfish](https://lichess.org/@/rand0mfish) on lichess]


## lichess.py & server.py

`lichess.py` can easily be used in other python bots. just give it an api token

`server.py` can also be used to make fully functioning lichess bots. just include `lichess.py` and make a bot class with your bot's logic (see `bot.py`)
